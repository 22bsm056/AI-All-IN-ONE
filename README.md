# What is Artificial Intelligence?

## Definition

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and solve problems like humans. AI systems can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

## Core Concepts

### Intelligence in Machines
AI enables machines to:
- Learn from experience
- Adapt to new inputs
- Perform human-like tasks
- Make decisions based on data
- Recognize patterns and anomalies

### Types of AI

#### 1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)
- Designed for specific tasks
- Most common form of AI today
- Examples: Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems, spam filters
- Limited to predefined functions

#### 2. General AI (Strong AI)
- Hypothetical AI with human-level intelligence
- Can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across different domains
- Does not currently exist
- Focus of ongoing research

#### 3. Super AI
- Theoretical AI that surpasses human intelligence
- Could potentially solve problems humans cannot
- Remains in the realm of speculation

## Key Components of AI

### Data
The fuel that powers AI systems. More quality data leads to better AI performance.

### Algorithms
Mathematical instructions that tell computers how to learn from data and make decisions.

### Computing Power
Advanced hardware that enables processing of large datasets and complex calculations.

### Learning Mechanisms
Methods by which AI systems improve their performance over time.

## How AI Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant information
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and organizing data
3. **Model Training**: Teaching algorithms using data
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying trends and relationships
5. **Prediction/Decision**: Making informed outputs
